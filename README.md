# confluent-kafka-addons
Addons for the `confluent_kafka` Python package that add support for optional features.

## Why does this exist?
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company has a bad habit, alongside many corporations of heavily benefitting from open-source software (OSS) without actually contributing back to it.

The department I work in in particular has a policy that all OSS contributions require departmental approval (and nothing gets approved).

This project exists because I ran into issues at work where these features would be or are actively useful and I wanted to make these features available to others without having to deal with Nationwides' OSS policy.
